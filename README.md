# QuizChallenge

This is an app for playing word quizzes.

## Project Description

**Functional Requirements:**
It's expected that the player will be able to:
- Insert words and have them counted as a hit as soon as the player types the last letter of each word.
- After a hit, the input box will be cleared and focus will remain on the input box.
- There will be a 5 min timer to finish the game.
    - If the player completes the quiz in less than 5 min, an alert will praise him.
    - If the player doesn't complete within 5 min, an alert will tell him his score.
    - There will be a button to start the timer.
